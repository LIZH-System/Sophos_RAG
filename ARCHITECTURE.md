# Sophos RAG Architecture

This document describes the architecture of Sophos RAG, focusing on how knowledge graphs, pre-trained models, and RAG components interact to create a system with low hallucination, low latency, and strong reasoning capabilities.

## System Overview

Sophos RAG extends traditional RAG systems with knowledge graph integration and enhanced reasoning capabilities:
